/*
 In the rolling horizon algorithm, some random variables may be produced using a time series model (ARIMA). With the ARIMA model,
 it is necessary to store a few deterministic terms separately for the ease computing. Focus on the AR part of ARIMA(p,d,q) model,
 a sliding window with length p is moving from hour t-p to t in step size n. The overlapping section between the sliding window and
 historical data (may be differenced data) is deterministic and can be stored before hand. (Note that it does not depend on 
 observations of omega).
 Phi_1 * w_n-1 + Phi_2 * w_n-2 + ... + Phi_p * w_n-p        <-This line can also be utilized for rolling
 Phi_2 * w_n-1 + Phi_3 * w_n-3 + ... + Phi_p * w_n-p+1
 ...
 where w is used to denote historical observation (deterministic)
 This will save some time (depends on amount of sub-hourly intervals and order p/q) when a new omega is generated. The stored value is valid
 for time period t only. As time evolves from t->t+, gammaType is updated with the latest observations.
 This structure can also be utilized by ARIMA model for new genrate.
